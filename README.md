### Reddit URL Switch

A simple extension to switch Reddit URLs.

### Description

This extension ensures a seamless browsing experience by automatically redirecting Reddit links to old.reddit.com. Whenever you click on a non-bookmarked Reddit URL (such as in a google search), you will be taken straight to the classic Reddit layout.

### Installation
The extension is available for download from Mozzila's extension marketplace [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-url-switch/)

### Future Plans
I would like to add a toggle that allows the user to switch between old and new layout versions based on the current layout.
